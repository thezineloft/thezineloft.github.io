    <h1>About The Zine Loft</h1>
     <center><p> 
    The Zine Loft is a cozy little corner for all things creative, a space where you’re invited to show up exactly as you are. Here, self-expression is welcome in every form, whether loud or quiet, messy or refined. It’s a place to connect, create, challenge, and simply be. Where art becomes voice, and strangers begin to feel like something softer. It’s for those learning to sit with the uncomfortable and still choosing to show up. So come as you are. Create what you feel and maybe leave carrying a little more of yourself- seen, understood, and gently held.

    <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
    <center><p>
    A bunch of strangers signed up for the beautiful Dormant Artists' workshop lovingly curated by none other than Shibani Mitra. Each person came in carrying a quiet longing — to create, to explore, to simply be. What unfolded was more than an event; it was a gentle unraveling. Through conversations, shared experiences, and creative sparks, a little community began to take shape.

    <center><p>
    It started off with us creating a zine on the theme of loneliness, an experience that turned out to be deeply cathartic. There’s something incredibly powerful about being in a space where you're allowed to be raw, where self-expression, in any form, isn’t judged but welcomed. To have a space and to be held in that way, where you can show up as you are, is a rare privilege. One we hold with deep gratitude.
