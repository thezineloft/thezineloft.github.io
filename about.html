    A bunch of strangers signed up for the beautiful Dormant Artists' workshop lovingly curated by none other than Shibani Mitra. Each person came in carrying a quiet longing — to create, to explore, to simply be. What unfolded was more than an event; it was a gentle unraveling. Through conversations, shared experiences, and creative sparks, a little community began to take shape.

    It started off with us creating a zine on the theme of loneliness, an experience that turned out to be deeply cathartic. There’s something incredibly powerful about being in a space where you're allowed to be raw, where self-expression, in any form, isn’t judged but welcomed. To have a space and to be held in that way, where you can show up as you are, is a rare privilege. One we hold with deep gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>That’s what Zine Loft is — a cozy little corner where creativity feels at home. A space to express, connect, explore, and simply be.
     A space for those learning to sit with the uncomfortable and still choose to show up. Where art becomes voice, and strangers slowly become something softer, something familiar.
